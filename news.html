                        <p>It seems like we say this every weekend, but this weekend's European soccer slate brought plenty of drama, joy, pain and talking points. Manchester United were woeful against City in the derby, Milan and Inter shared the points in their derby, and there were remarkable comebacks (and lessons) as Barcelona and Atletico Madrid both dropped points via late goals. Elsewhere, Bayern Munich kept rolling (but only just), Arsenal's magical form continues and two super-clubs (Juventus, PSG) continue to puzzle.</p>

                        <p>Lionel Messi is leaving Barcelona after a combination of the club's financial difficulties and La Liga's financial fair play rules meant a contract could not be finalised.
                            It was understood that Messi would be renewing his contract at Camp Nou despite revealing in an exclusive interview with Goal last year of his intentions to leave.</p>

Indian men's hockey team won an Olympic medal after a gap of 41 years. India's last of the eight Olympic golds came way back in the 1980 Moscow Games.</p>
